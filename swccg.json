He may provide nav computer capability on a starship as a passenger, but Brainiac is not an astromech and thus cannot occupy astromech capacity.\nImaginary numbers (which have a negative number within the square root) result in a minimum power of 1. Also, players must use the positive root (thus, the square root of 4 is 2, not -2).\nBrainiac's destiny and power should not be rounded. If you're comparing this number to a certain value, examine it to see if it meets the requirements. For example, if Alter targets Luke Skywalker and Brainiac is drawn, Alter succeeds (because p is less than 4), and if All Wings Report In targets your three YWings, it also succeeds (p is greater than 3). If Brainiac is drawn for battle destiny and a player must satisfy p attrition, that player must forfeit at least p points of forfeit value (usually meaning 4 must be forfeited). However, you must round whenever you are required to do something which is impossible in partial amounts (e.g., you cannot retrieve, activate, or lose an irrational amount of Force, you cannot cause an irrational number of characters to be lost, etc.). For example, Vader initiates a duel against Luke using Vader's Obsession (\"Each adds two destiny to power. Winner retrieves lost Force equal to the difference. Loser loses same amount of Force, plus the character.\"), and one of Luke's destinies is Brainiac. Vader's total is 14 and Luke's is 14.14159..., which means that Luke wins and retrieves Force equal to the difference (0.14159...). Because that's impossible, Light retrieves 0. Dark loses the same amount, also rounding to 0, and Vader, because even though no Force was lost or retrieved, Luke's total was still higher.",

    "Information": "Counter Assault can be one of the more powerful cards in the game, if used correctly. The ability to cancel a Force drain is terrific in any circumstance, and the added ability to nail your opponent for additional Force loss makes this card even better. However, there are several factors that make this card a risky proposition. First, there is a possibility that your opponent will match or beat your total, potentially increasing the damage. Also, the Light Side tends to have a higher destiny curve than the Dark Side does. Finally, due to the present rulings, Counter Assaulting in space is a risky proposition at best.",

    "Rules": "(AR 1.7.1, B-4)\nThe total power and number of destinies to be drawn is determined immediately when this Interrupt card begins resolving, and neither changes during the resolution. Thus if a character, starship or vehicle is introduced to the location during resolution of the Assault (such as via Tauntaun Bones) it does not add power and does not permit an additional destiny draw. Similarly, if cards are removed from the location during the resolution (such as by a Program Trap), they will still contribute power and still add a destiny draw for purposes of resolving the Counter Assault. This Interrupt does not cause a battle and thus cards may not be forfeited to reduce Force loss. Remember that, at a system location, characters and vehicles aboard starships are not present at the system. Therefore, for Counter Assault there will ordinarily only be one destiny draw per starship at the system but none for any cards aboard. Counter Assault may technically be played at a holosite but, since there are no characters present (only dejariks and holograms), no destiny will be drawn and zero will be compared to the opponent's total power.",

    "Information": "Startable with Heading For The Medical Frigate.\n-----\nArticle at DeckTech, September 19th, 2005\nTop 5 Battle-Aiding V-Cards (Light Side) by Armaedes and Shewski\n\nThis is much better than the dark side version, A Day Long Remembered (V), because it doesn't hurt you if you decide you want to keep it on the table. When facing Imperial Justice (V), the immunity reduction is good because otherwise it could be problematic cracking Lord Vader's immunity < 6. Also, since you are battling you can count on making your opponent lose lots of Dark Jedi as well as lots of battles, so the additional Force loss is important. Furthermore, the card is destiny-6 and easily cycles back into your Reserve Deck for easy tracking. If you generate enough Force - and every mains deck should have solid generation - it will be an easy thing to pay the 3 Force \"upkeep\" cost if you should need to.\n\nSHEWSKI'S TAKE:\nADLR is #2 on my DS listing, and I have to take exception with DWTE being better than it. These cards aren't meant to stay on the table- this card is wonderful to cycle through your deck for destiny of whatnot. The upkeep is manageable, but I can't think of any time I've used this card and kept it on the table by paying for it.\n-----\nArticle at DeckTech, September 19th, 2005\nTop 5 Battle-Aiding V-Cards (Dark Side) by Armaedes and Shewski\n\nDeploy on table. All immunity to attrition is reduced by 3. You may not fire permanent weapons. Whenever a Jedi is lost, or opponent loses a battle, opponent loses 1 Force. During your draw phase, lose 1 Force or place this card in your Used Pile. (Immune to Alter.)\n\nMuch like my #1 pick, I like the DS card a little more than the LS version. There are more Jedi that see play than Dark Jedi, and many have little immunity or none at all, which can mean guaranteed Force loss. This card is not meant to stay on the table, but cycle through your deck to show up as a big destiny draw or to deploy again for more Force loss. This works well w/ #1 as well, since you can't fire with your EPPs. The attrition reduction is a two-edged sword; so make sure you have some fodder. I can't tell you how many times it has turned a weak destiny draw into a site clearer. A great card that is fun to use along with other battle winning cards like Insignificant Rebellion.\n\nARMAEDES' TAKE:\nI agree completely with your assessment of the strengths of this card. The light side version made my list, but for dark side I just think there's far better battling helpers available. The strength of most of the powerful light side decks is EPP hit-and-run. I really only see the dark side version of this card being useful if you keep it on the table for a turn, so your opponent loses a Force from their EPP strike, or if you are going against an immunity-mains deck like Profit, which is unpopular at best, or the Careful Planning (V) Endor deck, which this card would work quite well against.",

    "Information": "Startable with Heading For The Medical Frigate.\n-----\nArticle at DeckTech, September 19th, 2005\nTop 5 Battle-Aiding V-Cards (Light Side) by Armaedes and Shewski\n\nThe reason this card is on the list is because it makes light side immunity mains good again. Now instead of dropping your EPP and taking out a couple of characters, you can drop down your immunity main and take out a couple of characters and still have the immunity main around next turn to drain on the location. This also stops your opponent from messing with your destiny draw via the senate objective, which is important if you want to really cause some battle damage. Although this card appears more defensive in nature it can actually be a very powerful offensive card.\n\nSHEWSKI'S TAKE:\nThis ranks just outside my top 5 on both sides. CD/AAA have already conditioned you to getting more mileage out your immunity mains, this just reinforces that principle. I don't like this in the early game in case a key card gets trapped under the Effect, but mid-game onwards it is a welcome play. I think this will also give those decks that rely solely upon immunity mains (THGG, WHAP, Invasion) a little bump into playability. Remember, total battle destiny can still be affected!!\n-----\nThis is the card old-school Star Wars CCG players have been waiting for since Reflections 3, a card that finally makes it to where your opponent can't use Boba Fett, Bounty Hunter, IG-88 With Riot Gun and 4-LOM With Concussion Rifle aboard Zuckuss In Mist Hunter to instantly end the game in a battle destiny-adding frenzy. Play this card - which you can start - and three battles per game you can limit both players to one battle destiny. Play two of this non-unique card and it's good for six battles per game, and few games have more than six battles (and not many have more than three).\n\nSo besides limiting destiny-adding fetishes, what does this card really mean for light side? For one thing, it means light side immunity mains are back. Ben Kenobi being immune < 5 used to mean nothing when he was facing multiple draws. Now immune < 5 can only be cracked by a solid destiny draw. Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight armed with his saber is basically immune to attrition. Obi-Wan Kenobi (V) is even better.\n\nThis card also works well in space. Playing I'll Take The Leader to give your Outrider immunity < 6 is huge now. The Millenium Falcon with the same Admiral's Order out is only going down to a draw of 7 or better. Home One is basically invincible.\n\nThis card really brings SWCCG back to where it should be - when main characters are able to stay on the table for more than a turn or two, and your opponent really has to bring the beats to get rid of a big, bad main. Matching pilot starships are also a lot stronger now, and all of this is tempered by the fact that you can't play Bright Hope (V) and Tantive IV (V) and rule the sky by cancelling your opponent's only destiny draw. This is also a great card to use if you find yourself going against a destiny-cancelling team, as using this effect will prevent your destiny draw from being cancelled.\n\nThis card is going to make a lot of light side decks viable again, as they won't have to worry about the Super-Fett beatdown as much. Dont' get goldenrody though - your opponent will still be able to brign a lot of power in your direction. Below is a deck that takes advantage of the newfound respect light mains are going to get due to this card. ",

    "Information": "Article at DeckTech, November 1st, 2005\nTop 5 Damage-Controlling V-Cards (Dark Side) by Armaedes and Shewski\n\nMuch ballyhooed when first released, these \"offensive\" Defensive Shields became a popular staple among most Shield lists. It's very easy to play since its initiation conditions are similar to another standby, Battle Order/Plan. These shields work to discourage cowardly play, like running away from battles on your turn (Watch out for Honor reducing this!) or not fighting you when they deploy to the table. Many decks have been built so that they can take full advantage of this gametext. [...]\n\nARMAEDES' TAKE:\nExcellent choice, this was actually #6 on my list. It barely missed the cut because the second portion of the text requires that you control a site and a system to make it work, and hardcore battling decks rarely do this. The part of the card that makes the opponent lose Force can be good, but frankly if your opponent has a choice between taking a beating and losing a measley two cards (which, as you point out, is reduced by Honor Of The Jedi), they're going to lose the 2 no questions asked. In other words, those this is a card that should be played in every battling deck, it doesn't actually help your big battles happen because the opponent is still able to use their \"escape\" cards, they just have to lose a couple of Force to do so - which oftentimes is a fair trade.",

Solo's ability being a top level action and the nature of interrupts. For example, Whoooo! can be played by Han to take an N-1 starfighter into hand during a battle, but it can't be played to make Droid Starfighters power -1 because it would have to be played in response to a battle; likewise a card like The Signal has one part that can only be played at the start of the game, yet clearly is only in the deck to be used in its other aspect as a Used interrupt.

Therefore cards that are immune to Alter based on a condition in their game text (such as Come Here You Big Coward) cannot be deployed with this starting interrupt. Cards which are immune to Alter in their game text but can have that immunity canceled by other cards may be deployed using this Interrupt. For example, Prepared Defenses could still be used to deploy Mobilization Points even if Don't Do That Again was on table. When deploying Effects using this Starting Interrupt, each Effect deploys separately, and all automatic actions resolve normally. Thus if this starting interrupt is used to deploy Naboo Occupation, No Escape, and Imperial Arrest Order, Naboo Occupation may be deployed first (and will be immediately lost), followed by No Escape (which allows the dark side player to take the top card of the lost pile into hand) followed by Imperial Arrest Order.",

During your Control Phase, you can attempt to damage and slow down an opponent's Podracer whose race total is within 4 of your own. This means you can either try to overtake a racer who is slightly ahead of yours, or you can try to create a setback for a racer gaining on one of your own. Since race destiny is drawn during the Dark Side's Control Phase, the Dark Side player has the option of playing this card before or after race destinies are drawn, although playing Hit Racer first is wise, since you may eliminate your opponent's race destiny this turn.\n\nIf you successfully damage your opponent's racer, you get the immediate benefit of causing the Light Side to skip a race destiny. But even better than that is the added game text. Until the target racer is repaired, the Light Side will have to lose 1 Force in order to use any race destiny. This will potentially cause them to gradually fall behind your racer as they make hard decisions about what race destinies to keep.\n\nThis card is probably best used when you are within reach of winning the race. After all, since the Light Side will retrieve 6 Force for winning the race (and even more if they're playing with cards like I Did It!), he probably won't mind losing a couple of Force in order to use race destinies that will take him across the finish line first.\n\nOf course, your opponent will need to be playing Anakin's Podracer for this to work, since Hit Racer cannot be played on a generic podracer. But with the importance that racing is likely to have in the game, it shouldn't be surprising to see Anakin's Podracer showing up in many decks.",

There's really no easier way to reduce damage, as it requires no commitment from the Dark Side player other than that they commit a card slot to a destiny-6 Effect. If Vader's hanging around an adjacent site, this card will obviously become even more powerful. Simple Effect that can make a huge difference in a game.\n\nSHEWSKI'S TAKE:\n\nWow, talk about an obvious miss on my part- great idea for a damage controller. The LS version (Projection of a Skywalker) was played quite a bit for similar reasons. The one thing that I don't like about this card is its fixed location. If you temper a drain at a planet where there are multiple sites, your opponent can always move around it. It works best at key drain locations where the enhancers (unlike lightsabers) are fixed as well.",

In addition to offering some solid character retrieval, this card also does a decent job of causing your opponent to spread out quickly so that they can suspend the gametext of this card. The battle destiny limiting may seem like a bad idea for a battling deck, but in reality there aren't a lot of ways for all-Imperial decks to get multiple battle destiny anyway, and this way you can use characters like Lord Vader and have the immunity to attrition be worth more than if you had to worry about your opponent drawing 5 battle destiny and basically making your immunity worthless. Another reason this is a solid battling card is because if you draw battle or weapon destiny and accidentally flip a character, you can take it into hand and try again, allowing you to play with more characters than you would normally be able to get away with while still maintaining the integrity of the deck's destiny.\n\nSHEWSKI'S TAKE:\nWow, great minds think alike. This is my #5 as well. I really like the versatility that this card brings to an Imperial deck and think that as stronger Imperials are created this card will see more and more play.\nArmaedes made a bunch of good points about this card above, but there were a few things I also wanted to add. First, two copies of this can be played for maximum use, which means twice as many benefits heading your way. It may be overkill in many instances, but if it is worth it, you'll never go without characters ever again. Secondly, there are some creative ways for you to use it as a cycling machine. DDM had an interesting Hunt Down that used a lone Womp Rat to constantly draw against Vader so that he could draw needed Imperials into hand. I also don't think that limited destiny draws as a bad thing- with you constantly weeding out low destiny characters your 2 destinies should be stronger than your opponent's. This is also yet another great battle winning effect that works with many of the other cards on this list.\n\nARMAEDES' TAKE:\nNo argument here, and the two-copies thing is an important point I forgot to mention. I have seen this card used effectively in Hunt Down, BHBM, ISB, Ralltiir, and even some Combat Readiness (V) decks. Like Ability, Ability, Ability (V), it's good because it rewards you for battling by giving you more characters to battle with. Unlike Ability, Ability, Ability (V), it's far more deck-specific, but getting back characters is always a good thing.",

However, if you consider the \"Dejarik Rules\" for a moment, you will see the true power of this location.\n\nOnly dejarik and hologram cards can exist at a holosite. Since there are so few of them in the Star Wars CCG card set, you're pretty safe from being battled at the Imperial Holotable.\n\nHolosites allow dejariks and holograms to deploy and battle there as if they were characters. However, they are not characters and are not targetable as characters, interrupts or effects . . . they are dejariks and holograms! So you're completely safe from cards like Surprise Assault.\n\nWhen you deploy a dejarik or hologram card to a holosite, use its destiny number as its deploy, forfeit, power and ability numbers. Battles at holosites are similar to battles at other sites (including destiny draws and attrition if you have 4 or more ability present). So Visage Of The Emperor (destiny = power = ability = 7) and Image Of The Dark Lord (destiny = power = ability = 6) are extremely powerful holograms to be reckoned with at the Imperial Holotable - the Light Side doesn't have any dejariks or holograms that can compete with these cards on a one-to-one basis!\n\nI like to start with the Imperial Holotable, and pack two Visage Of The Emperor, two Image Of The Dark Lord, and two Monnok cards in my deck. This number of dejariks and holograms assures me a card that I can deploy to the Imperial Holotable on my first couple of turns, and gives me a nice, steady (and safe!)

    "Information": "Article at DeckTech, September 19th, 2005\nTop 5 Battle-Aiding V-Cards (Light Side) by Armaedes and Shewski\n\nLast on the list because of how specific it is, but still a solid battling helper due to its ability to cancel just about every battle evasion method dark side can come up with. The trick is that it has to be targeting a Jedi, but frankly most light battling decks are going to be heavy on the Jedi anyway (Mace Windu (V), Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi and possible a Jedi persona of Luke Skywalker). Cancelling battle evasion is obviously a very good thing for a battling deck, but the card doesn't stop there. If your main should survive the battle and are still at the site, and the dark player retaliates, you can use this card to take the first action of the weapons phase, which means you can strike out at one of your opponent's characters before they have a chance to do any tricks with Dr. Evazan or Dark Strike.\n\nSHEWSKI'S TAKE:\n#5?? Aw, man it's my #1. I don't want to steal my own thunder- so read on. I think this was a very good card to come out of the player designed card experiment.\nWhen you deploy to battle in modern SWCCG, the biggest thing you fear is the re-beat, where your opponent minimizes your offensive power, reinforces on their turn, and then beats you down. Evasion and character removal are two prime ways to slow down a feisty LS player. IMI takes care of it all. I don't think its specificity is a hindrance at all. Barrier will often be saved for your big guns (Jedi). Most battles involve Jedi (Stunning), and YAB will target those aforementioned big guns. Being able to battle on your own terms is very nice. The secondary text is quite nice as well, as Armaedes pointed out. Though protective in nature, it can turn a defensive battle into an offensive one quickly.\n\nARMAEDES' TAKE:\nI agree that this is a great card, but #1? This is a very deck-specific card, as it won't work in a battling deck that isn't mains, and even in a mains deck it won't help you with EPP Luke. A very nice card no doubt, as it made my own list, but not an auto-play by any means.",

Since that would require a revision to thousands of cards, that's simply not practical. Every effort has been made to identify and discern what are and are not characteristics. Some may be missing from the list, while others are deliberately absent. Discerning which is which requires a bit of research and judgment.\n\nAfter investigating, we're adding skiff and sandcrawler to the list of characteristics which apply to vehicles.\n\nThis brings us to the matter of (LS) Intruder Missile. This weapon and its possible interaction with Outrider has been a matter the PC has been considering for some time. By the rules, the one could not deploy on the other, but we were not ignorant of the possibility that this was an error of omission. Having looked through the evidence, we're now confident that Intruder Missile was not intended to work with Outrider.\n\nWe do not make these decisions lightly, and attempt to be thorough in our research of the original intent of the card interactions. We searched the records of play testing that we have from the development of Shadows of the Empire (the set that was incorporated into Reflections 2). In an original version of the Outrider, it was created to work with Intruder Missile, both via game text and the inclusion of the \"YT-2400\" in the subtype box. However, the game text was stricken over the course of play testing, and the \"YT-2400\" text moved out of the subtype box into the lore. This move was significant - the characteristic rules were well in place at this time, and Decipher had ensured that references to starships were almost entirely to icons or the contents of the subtype box. The only exceptions to this were defined characteristics (all ships are enclosed and all TIE/sa and B-wings are bombers) or squadron designations (which could be found in title, lore, or game text). Decipher, in fact, released only one card which was referenced by its lore instead of subtype: Blockade Flagship, because \"Droid Control Ship\" would not fit in that box - and Decipher then made a note to declare Droid Control Ship a characteristic.\n\nNeither of these cases applied to Outrider - our tests using the original templates showed that \"YT-2400\" would fit with room to spare, and we know that Decipher made no such announcement. In addition, the text on Intruder Missile states that it also may deploy on the Falcon. It was not until two years after Intruder Missile came out that a Falcon was created that didn't state \"YT-1300\" in lore (both the original and Lando in Millennium Falcon did). If Decipher intended to reference it in lore, this specific mention wouldn't have been necessary.\n\nGiven the state of the characteristic rules at the time by Decipher, the striking of the game text, and the deliberate choice to remove a referenced card aspect from the subtype box, we feel this is sufficient evidence to support the existing ruling: Intruder Missile may not deploy on Outrider.\n\nBecause this matter has confused many players over the years, we are going to issue the following errata to Intruder Missile (LS) in the hopes of minimizing further confusion:\n\nLS Intruder Missile:\nDeploy on your B-wing, Z-95, YT-1300 Transport, or Falcon. May target a capital starship for free. Draw destiny. Add 3 if that capital starship was targeted by another weapon this turn. Target hit if total destiny > defense value.

Jabba The Hutt (V) is very deck-specific, which is why he's not higher on my list, but in an alien deck he can end games on the 2nd or 3rd turn. I have personally had Jabba The Hutt (V) cause more than 50 overflow in games, and I know other players who have got that number even higher. With the number of ways dark side has to pull aliens from the deck, and with Jabba (V) doubling the power of almost all of them, you can create devastating beatdowns in record time. The best part is that the Audience Chamber deploys him from Reserve Deck and then Elis Helrot takes him wherever the fighting is. Truly a brutal battling card.\n\nSHEWSKI'S TAKE:\nWell, I might take exception on the power of Scum being focused on him, but you are right that he is a potent card. I mean, winning a battle by 20 and winning it by 40 both hurt your opponent, but both are likely game winners. I didn't rank him on my list since I don't really like what he brings to the world of SWCCG. I think there were plenty of other cool Jabbas that Scum decks could run, plus I have trouble envisioning Jabba being a flying beatdown machine.",

The Dark Side is rife with popular ways to get rid of your heroes such as Dr. Evazan, Dark Strike, and Choke Vader. K'lor Slug (and Molator for the DS) helps you avoid painful beatdowns due to sudden losses of power and destiny draws. While this is more like IMI in that it helps your battles hold their effectiveness, the second part of the text goes very well with immunity mains. Your mains can get out at their normal cost, which greatly speeds up the time it takes to get them into play by a turn or more.\n\nARMAEDES' TAKE:\nAgain, I find this less of an offensive aid than a defensive aid, and more of a battle-hindering card than anything else. The dark side's character removal is a big way dark wins battles, so in my opinion taking this away makes effective battling more challenging. I really like this card - I think it is a necessary component of the game - but I'm not sure I would classify it as a battling aid.",

She is a very cheap destiny draw that allows for an early disruption of the Dark Side's setup. Though envisioned as an anti-Senate card, she has many other strong uses. Most used is probably her leader canceling game text, which can set up some beats of her own. She can take the teeth out of Jabba, Xizor, P-59, Fel, Igar, Ephant Mon, Veers, Thrawn, and Tarkin. This text always works as well. Typically, such a powerful card wouldn't be so cheap, but she has been an early thorn in my opponent's side for some time now. Usually my choice for a utility Leia, but Princess Leia (V) deserves consideration as well.\n\nARMAEDES' TAKE:\nYES! Leia (V) is a fantastic battling card. Not only does she have strong gametext for battling herself, but she also takes a bite out of senate, which is a deck that makes effective battling by the light side more challenging. I would even put this Leia above EPP Leia for battling effectiveness. Great pick by Shewski!",

    "Information": "The Lost game text on this Used or Lost Interrupt is, well, a little lost on us for the moment. A dueling version of Projective Telepathy, this card makes the Light Side choose to either lose 4 Force or cancel a duel they just initiated. At the moment, there are only two ways for the Light Side to initiate a duel. The first is through Jedi Test #6, a strategy not seen very often. The second (and more likely to be seen) is the Interrupt from Tatooine, You'll Find I'm Full Of Surprises, which gives Luke some dueling ability. Lightsaber Parry will be useful against this card, as well as any future duel-initiating ability the Light Side might gain in the future.\n\nLightsaber Parry also provides some interesting Used game text. If the Dark Side has a lightsaber in a just-initiated battle, this card will eliminate the ability of all lightsabers present to target characters. At first glance, this might seem a little silly. After all, while the Light Side won't be slicing and dicing, the Dark Side can't use their lightsabers, either. But there is a method to the madness. The Light Side still outnumbers the Dark in number of characters who can use the various unique lightsabers. In addition, the Light Side has a little more versatility, with Anakin's Lightsaber being usable by either Luke or Leia. These facts add up to a decent chance that the Light Side will have more lightsabers in a battle than the Dark Side. Now, sacrificing Darth Maul's chance to hit an opponent is more than offset by the fact that you have saved several of your characters from the blade.\n\nThis text can also be useful when you have an important character with a low defense value in the battle. Characters with 1, 2, or even 3 ability are almost sure to be hit by a lightsaber. Now your Dark Jedi can keep that character alive and kicking for at least another turn. And since this part of Lightsaber Parry is a Used Interrupt, your Dark Jedi will be able to come to the rescue again, and again, and again...",

Your objective pulled the sites, then once you controlled three, you flipped. The flip side made all DS drains -1, your operatives added +1 to force drains, deployed for one, forfeit for like 4 or 5, added a destiny at all sites while you had just one operative on the planet, and you retrieved a force every time you simply deployed one to a site. They were even power +2 against an Imperial. This was totally not a Star Wars movie idea, just crap that hurt the game. The reason this objective was even made was because Lucas denied the creation for some of the card designs only weeks before the release of Special Edition. To fix this last minute problem, the Operative strategy was added without ANY play testing.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE: Because of all the problems this objective caused. Decipher created three cards that completely hurt this deck as well as an errata to the rules saying that only one operative may be at a site, anymore would be lost. They also no longer have presence, so they can't control a site by themselves. This objective is considered to be DEAD. Decipher created this idea with no thought of what they were doing.

The flip side made all DS drains -1, your operatives added +1 to force drains, deployed for one, forfeit for like 4 or 5, added a destiny at all sites while you had just one operative on the planet, and you retrieved a force every time you simply deployed one to a site. They were even power +2 against an Imperial. This was totally not a Star Wars movie idea, just crap that hurt the game. The reason this objective was even made was because Lucas denied the creation for some of the card designs only weeks before the release of Special Edition. To fix this last minute problem, the Operative strategy was added without ANY play testing.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE: Because of all the problems this objective caused. Decipher created three cards that completely hurt this deck as well as an errata to the rules saying that only one operative may be at a site, anymore would be lost. They also no longer have presence, so they can't control a site by themselves. This objective is considered to be DEAD. Decipher created this idea with no thought of what they were doing. This objective is one that we all wish they had never made. It won the '98 worlds for both sides because it was a broken idea.",

When on Our Blockade is Perfectly Legal, he helps you 'blockade' your opponent by hindering your opponent's out of phase movement.\n\nBut he also helps you when he's on the table, imagine that! With his blockade agenda, he lets you flip My Lord, Is That Legal? with one less senator. But perhaps more importantly, if you have political control of the Galactic Senate, he gives you access to an incredibly powerful ability. Letting you look through your Force Pile allows you to take a key card into hand; it could be a critical character you need to battle, a matching weapon for your Darth Maul, or any other card, it can all be yours, if you have a Senate majority. And in a pinch he helps his fellow Neimoidians out by adding to their forfeit.",

Some things just take time, and Maul can happily take a big step up the main character chain with Maul Strikes.\n\nThe three uses this card has are all extremely powerful. When you draw this card, one of its uses will almost certainly be needed immediately. Light Side players have been able to pull Lightsabers out of their decks for years with Gift Of The Mentor, and now Maul Strikes allows the Dark Side to finally have their turn at this great ability.\n\nAnother minor weakness of the Tatooine persona of Darth Maul was that his ability to duel was a bit restricted, since he had to essentially survive an entire turn before he had the chance to duel anybody. With Maul Strikes, however, the Sith Lord can bypass that restriction, and duel at any time by simply playing this interrupt.\n\nAnd finally, if you're looking for just some good old beatdown, Maul can add battle destiny with this card too. Instead of just dueling Qui-Gon and making him lost, why not battle him, cut him, and draw three battle destiny as well? The answer is simple.",

Darth Maul (Tatooine Expansion) can effectively ignore the presence of Light Side characters of ability less than 4. This means he can Force drain while at their site, using Maul's Lightsaber to add 1 to the Force drain. He can also use cards like Sniper to take pot-shots at those poor, low-ability characters, gradually reducing their numbers at his site.

    "Information": "Startable with Prepared Defenses.\n-----\nArticle at DeckTech, September 19th, 2005\nTop 5 Battle-Aiding V-Cards (Light Side) by Armaedes and Shewski\n\nOne of my pet peeves, briefly touched upon under #1, is character removal. The Dark Side is rife with popular ways to get rid of your heroes such as Dr. Evazan, Dark Strike, and Choke Vader. K'lor Slug (and Molator for the DS) helps you avoid painful beatdowns due to sudden losses of power and destiny draws. While this is more like IMI in that it helps your battles hold their effectiveness, the second part of the text goes very well with immunity mains. Your mains can get out at their normal cost, which greatly speeds up the time it takes to get them into play by a turn or more.\n\nARMAEDES' TAKE:\nAgain, I find this less of an offensive aid than a defensive aid, and more of a battle-hindering card than anything else. The dark side's character removal is a big way dark wins battles, so in my opinion taking this away makes effective battling more challenging. I really like this card - I think it is a necessary component of the game - but I'm not sure I would classify it as a battling aid.",

Since that would require a revision to thousands of cards, that's simply not practical. Every effort has been made to identify and discern what are and are not characteristics. Some may be missing from the list, while others are deliberately absent. Discerning which is which requires a bit of research and judgment.\n\nAfter investigating, we're adding skiff and sandcrawler to the list of characteristics which apply to vehicles.\n\nThis brings us to the matter of (LS) Intruder Missile. This weapon and its possible interaction with Outrider has been a matter the PC has been considering for some time. By the rules, the one could not deploy on the other, but we were not ignorant of the possibility that this was an error of omission. Having looked through the evidence, we're now confident that Intruder Missile was not intended to work with Outrider.\n\nWe do not make these decisions lightly, and attempt to be thorough in our research of the original intent of the card interactions. We searched the records of play testing that we have from the development of Shadows of the Empire (the set that was incorporated into Reflections 2). In an original version of the Outrider, it was created to work with Intruder Missile, both via game text and the inclusion of the \"YT-2400\" in the subtype box. However, the game text was stricken over the course of play testing, and the \"YT-2400\" text moved out of the subtype box into the lore. This move was significant - the characteristic rules were well in place at this time, and Decipher had ensured that references to starships were almost entirely to icons or the contents of the subtype box. The only exceptions to this were defined characteristics (all ships are enclosed and all TIE/sa and B-wings are bombers) or squadron designations (which could be found in title, lore, or game text). Decipher, in fact, released only one card which was referenced by its lore instead of subtype: Blockade Flagship, because \"Droid Control Ship\" would not fit in that box - and Decipher then made a note to declare Droid Control Ship a characteristic.\n\nNeither of these cases applied to Outrider - our tests using the original templates showed that \"YT-2400\" would fit with room to spare, and we know that Decipher made no such announcement. In addition, the text on Intruder Missile states that it also may deploy on the Falcon. It was not until two years after Intruder Missile came out that a Falcon was created that didn't state \"YT-1300\" in lore (both the original and Lando in Millennium Falcon did). If Decipher intended to reference it in lore, this specific mention wouldn't have been necessary.\n\nGiven the state of the characteristic rules at the time by Decipher, the striking of the game text, and the deliberate choice to remove a referenced card aspect from the subtype box, we feel this is sufficient evidence to support the existing ruling: Intruder Missile may not deploy on Outrider.\n\nBecause this matter has confused many players over the years, we are going to issue the following errata to Intruder Missile (LS) in the hopes of minimizing further confusion:\n\nLS Intruder Missile:\nDeploy on your B-wing, Z-95, YT-1300 Transport, or Falcon. May target a capital starship for free. Draw destiny. Add 3 if that capital starship was targeted by another weapon this turn. Target hit if total destiny > defense value.

    "Information": "Traditionally, non-lightsaber weapon cards haven't fared too well in SWCCG decks. For one thing, it is difficult to get both the character and his matching weapon into play together without packing extra copies of both cards. And once the weapon is in play, it tends to have a lower chance of hitting a high defense value target than those lightsabers that get two weapon destinies. Finally, most weapons don't have the extra damage that lightsabers can cause through Force drains. Panaka's Blaster looks to be the weapon that bucks the binder fodder trend.\n\nPanaka's Blaster can easily get on the table, since Captain Panaka's game text allows you to deploy a blaster from your Reserve deck. That solves the problem of getting the weapon out where it will do some good. It also has a very respectable chance of hitting a target, requiring a weapon destiny +2 greater than the target's defense value. Of course, the weapon destiny draw can be boosted with cards like Blaster Proficiency.\n\nBeyond these basic characteristics, Panaka's Blaster has two more things going for it. First, if the blaster hits a target in a battle, the Light Side's total power in that battle is +3. The final bonus comes from game text on Captain Panaka: if Panaka hits a character with a blaster, your opponent has to lose 2 Force. This text is an interesting bit of direct damage that encourages the Light Side to battle early and often.\n\nAnd for those players who really miss the Force drain bonus of lightsabers, there's always the used interrupt Rebel Artillery, which causes a 1 Force loss at a site you control where a non-lightsaber weapon is present. In battle, this interrupt can also cause an additional Force loss when Panaka hits a character. Overall, Panaka's Blaster is one of the most attractive weapons without a glowing blade this game has seen. ",

She may look beguilingly gentle, and most the time she is, but behind that enigmatic smile lies a woman you want on your side when you lead your forces into opposition territory!\n\nAbility 4 is a great start. Add the fact that she is an experienced and effective +2 pilot, and it's now definitely worth paying 4 to deploy her. She's even immune to M'iiyoom! Do you believe though that you can deploy her for free to any docking bay!? Usually not hard to find one of those in today's environment! The ability to deploy free is huge, and almost single-handedly justifies her inclusion in most Light Side decks. For example, stock a docking bay and Insurrection (who doesn't? Especially with a combo version imminent!) and she can now be added to even your world-beating Watch Your Step deck.\n\nAll this, and we haven't even got to the kicker. Get her to your opponent's docking bay, preferably with a little backup (cause she attracts a lot of attention!), and suddenly the opponent may be left regretting that he ever started with Imperial Arrest Order. Your characters there receive a boosted defense value, and even some immunity. This all represents the fact that this lady of the hyperspace lane knows her way around spaceports as if she was born there.\n\nIf your Phylo-led expeditionary force takes the docking bay for their own, your drains there are now +2. Thats a drain of 3 at every one of a dozen of your opponent's docking bays. If you are protecting her with an appropriately armed Qui-Gon (who is now defense value 8!), then that saber will be adding to the Force drain insult.\n\nWith that sort of damage, suddenly your opponent is being forcibly diverted from more important tasks (like flipping his objective) as he is comitted to throwing resources to defend what was only going to be a site for a little force-generation. That may well tilt the game your way.\n\nSo with this wonder woman on your side, what do you have to fear? Weapon fire and attrition are the biggest threats, as Gandish may very well be the only one of your characters at that location who is not immune. As for weapons, sabers will paint her with a big target sign, and 4-LOM may very well find her to be a firm favorite in his targeting reticle. If you want to play sneaky, put her inside a vehicle for a little weapon and choke protection, perhaps even aboard a Rogue Squadron snowspeeder for some immunity as well (if you can get the appropriate pilot aboard). Remember, she will still be working her magic, and also adding 2 power - more than she would if left exposed on the ground.\n\nKeep an eye out for this great gal! You're going to be seeing a lot of her. And remember, beware the double-edged sword that is the unattended docking bay!",

This text can be used offensively or defensively. If you just drew a system or a main character for battle destiny, cancel it and redraw, likely causing more damage to your opponent in the process. On the other hand, if Darth Maul just got lucky and hit Obi-Wan with his lightsaber, cause a redraw in the hopes that the second draw might not be as good.\nThis text can really come in handy in the endgame, when your opponent might have just enough cards in his Reserve Deck for that lightsaber swing and a battle destiny.

Like the traditional cards, this may be played when you have Leia and Chewie together in a battle. Your benefit is 2 added battle destiny. This is an impressive twist, as all other of the destiny-adding teamwork cards involve Luke. In a Teamwork-based deck, this can surprise an opponent who expects these powerful interrupts only from combinations involving Luke. And no one can deny the power of an extra 2 destiny in a battle, especially in a high destiny deck, as a Teamwork deck tends to be.\n\nThe extra text is quite useful. In fact, I'd venture to say that it is the most powerful yet. It allows you, if Leia is in a battle, to forfeit Chewie from your hand to satisfy all battle damage and attrition. This is quite nasty in conjunction with a few other cards. Obviously, you can use this to keep a squad of characters on the Death Star while your opponent is forced to lose some of his built up defense, but there are more subtle strategies.\n\nOne is an odd twist on the familiar Ghhhk strategy. One would play a lone TIE Fighter at a system and drain. When the opponent deployed there, he would play a Lone Pilot and then Ghhhk to avoid the damage. You can do something similar with this, and, in fact, the effect is much more devastating. With Princess Leia on the table, if you play Warrior's Courage, you get 3 battle destiny when she's alone. Then, simply play Protector, and lose Chewie, and she stays on the table. Doubly effective if she's been trained, or if she's carrying a Lightsaber.\n\nThe added cancelling ability can be useful as well, cancelling two very annoying interrupts. Frustration can be a pain in a deck designed for it, and cancelling I'd Just As Soon Kiss A Wookiee can be an added reassurance that your cards are going to get into play.",

The two extra destiny from this, plus the extra destiny from Captain Han and a destiny for ability of 4, adds 4 destiny draws to an already formidable Force.\n\nThe card has an extra ability that's dangerous, too. With Captain Han on the Falcon, you can get him to the Death Star and sit and drain. If your opponent tries to battle you, you can play this card for the extra 2 destiny and for immunity to attrition.

This combat was in the form of a brief duel with Darth Maul. It should come as no surprise that Qui-gon's gametext reflects this conflict with Maul. When at a site with Maul, Qui-gon gets a power bonus that brings him to the same level as his nemesis, allowing them to start a battle on even ground. In addition, if Maul is bold enough to start a duel against Qui-gon, the Jedi Master has the ability to cancel a destiny draw and cause a redraw. While this text doesn't give Qui-gon an advantage in the number of duel destinies drawn, it does give him the opportunity to potentially reduce a high Dark Side destiny or increase an unfortunate destiny draw of his own.\n\nFinally, Qui-gon Jinn is able to reduce the effectiveness of opponent's aliens at the same site by reducing their power by 1. This trick can be very useful when presented with a swarm of aliens, bringing their high power down to a more manageable level.",

The answer came out with Jabba's Palace, when we learned that Rennek was the king of the sruffy-looking nerf herders. With Power and Ability of only one, the little Rennek seems pretty ordinary, but when you look at his game text, you realize he has the power to change the course of a game. First, he prevents all creatures from attacking at his site (except the almighty Sarlacc, who don't listen to anything but it's stomach), thus protecting you from such nasties as Bubo, the Wampas and especially the roaming Rancors. By keeping Rennek with your small power characters, you can use their game texts longer. The second part of his game text is also interesting: you can raise Rennek's Power three times per turn for only one Force each time! In the mid-game, when you have plenty of Force, Rennek is an argument that your opponent will have to consider. With Who's Scruffy-Looking?, you can double Rennek's Power, thus showing that unusual combat techniques are sometimes the best.",

    "Information": "One of the many force retrieval methods for the Light Side, Rycar's Run stands above the rest. First of all, it is efficiant. Combined with an Asteroid Sancuary deck, you don't have to put in any useless cards to make Rycar's Run work. The only other things you need are Closers, and those have a destiny of 6, and they are used. Rycar's run also only takes 2 turns to pull off, if you use a Closer each turn. Also, you get 8 Force (assuming all asteroid sectors are present, which shouldn't be a problem in an Asteroid Sanctuary deck) for just losing 1 card and using others that you would be using regardless. No destiny draws, you know what you are getting, and it sets you up for another 'Run. You can't lose it by having your target/ship killed with an Interrupt like Gravity Shadow with Kessel Run, or Look Sir, Droids with Death Star Plans.\n\nThe problem arises with that one turn where your ship gets stranded out at the Big One. This is easily conquered with Cap'n Han on the Falcon with R2-D2, Chewie, and maybe even some Special Mods. Or even R2-D2 and Luke on Red 5. This pretty much makes your ship tough to get with battles, and nearly impossible (watch out for DS asteroid decks) to kill with Asteroids, ensuring that the 'Run goes through. So, what Rycar's Run actually does for your Asteroid Sancuary Deck is to make you last longer against ground-drain decks without incorporating unreliable undercover spies. I would recommend putting about 4 of them in a Sancuary deck, along with 6 Closers. ",

This is one of the large nails that Endor put in the old school Hidden Base deck. It allows you to compete in space without having to devote as much starship power as the Light Side Hidden Base player probably has devoted. It carries two side effects. One is to discourage the Hidden Base player form attempting an early flip. Once probing begins and he only has 5 systems in play, you can knock them short time. Nasty damage for Light Side is the result. It pays for the Hidden Base player to delay for a few more systems, forcing that awful decision of whether or not the should flip early to go for the drains or hold out until they can scare you away from space altogether. The Imperial Navy is not easy to scare.\n\nAdditionally, your somewhat more meager fleet is protected form the perils of the outrageous one turn beat-down - a common complaint from old X-Wing S-Foil swarms which could devastate the Imperial Fleet as well as the Dark Side Reserve Deck in one blow! The other function just increases the utility of this card, adding a bit of Force generation - even providing a little extra help against Force Choke decks.

    "Information": "Scrambled Transmission makes Shocking Information immune to Sense.\n-----\nAt the moment, a lot of people are using variants of Mike Riboulet's Dark Sided Manipulator. This involves the opponent scanning your hand in many ways - including Onith and Scanning Crew. By having an Information up your sleeve, you can't cancel the scan but you can lose the card which allowed the scan and the DS lose 4 Force as well! If the opponent doesn't have any scanning cards in his deck, this card is not wasted - it's destiny 5, and a Used Interrupt which can be recycled with its other function. There is a DS version of this card, Shocking Revelation, but it's of much less value.\n\n\nThis card provides defense against some very strong Premiere strategies that have thrived on the tournament scene. Also, it provides an easy way to cycle itself back into the Life Force and prevent Monnok from causing the damaging loss of doubles. This card can be played on any location, regardless of whether there is a scomp link on the location card.\n\nThe five destiny can be cycled very easily, which is excellent for monitoring high destiny draws. Before this card, players would often have to rely on playing A Few Maneuvers or Dark Maneuvers, which also required a starfighter to be in play. The drawback is that the destiny number is slightly lower.\n\nThe most obvious use of this card is to protect against Scanning Crew and M'iiyoom Onith. The loss of four Force, plus the card causing the scan can suggest to the opponent that searching should only be done in the case of true necessity. This will help the Light Side player climb out from underneath a couple of extremely strong lock down strategies. ",

    "Information": "This is another equalizer for you anti-Mains and Toys players out there, especially with the release of Cloud City. Two things in Cloud City made this card especially great: interior draining and Trooper Assault.\n\nSince Stunning Leader only works at interior sites, most people found little use for it before Cloud City. After all, the best draining sites for the Dark Side were almost exclusively exterior! Virtually every Dark Side site with a Force drain for two or more was an exterior site like the Tatooine: Lars' Moisture Farm, Tatooine: Jundland Wastes, or Hoth: Defensive Perimeter.\nWith the release of Cloud City, the Dark Side now has a set of interior sites with decent draining opportunities. Unlike the Death Star or Executor sites, these have Light Side icons allowing a modest drain. Adding Dark Deal to a Cloud City deck could be devastating to an ill-prepared Light Side deck. With lightsabers and Dark Deal, Cloud City is an okay place to Force drain for the Dark Side. Oh, and don't forget about Bounty Hunting opportunities.\n\nAlong with Cloud City's interior sites came a nice Used Interrupt called Trooper Assault. This card simulates the endless hordes of troopers the Imperial Army seems to muster by making all Dark Side troopers in a battle power +2 and immune to all attrition. This one interrupt almost single-handedly made troopers viable again.\n\nSo where does Stunning Leader fit into the equation? Well, consider a Cloud City Force drain deck with troopers as its primary site defenses. Every site (don't use the Docking Bay) is interior, meaning Stunning Leader can be played at a site battle anywhere. All troopers are ability 2 or lower, so they won't be excluded from the battle when Stunning Leader is played - this interrupt isolates your troopers against the Light Side's non-mains.",

That's what I like to call sledgehammer politics.

You remember all those \"baseless\" accusations we heard about in the movie? Well, they're back with a vengeance. As long as your opponent has Force to spend, he can reduce Valorum's Politics infinitely.

Thus if a character, starship or vehicle is introduced to the location during resolution of the Assault (such as via Tauntaun Bones) it does not add power and does not permit an additional destiny draw. Similarly, if cards are removed from the location during the resolution (such as by a Program Trap), they will still contribute power and still add a destiny draw for purposes of resolving the Counter Assault. This Interrupt does not cause a battle and thus cards may not be forfeited to reduce Force loss. Remember that, at a system location, characters and vehicles aboard starships are not present at the system. Therefore, for Counter Assault there will ordinarily only be one destiny draw per starship at the system but none for any cards aboard. Counter Assault may technically be played at a holosite but, since there are no characters present (only dejariks and holograms), no destiny will be drawn and zero will be compared to the opponent's total power.",

One of the easiest ways to retrieve Force.\n\nDeath Star Docking Bay + Death Star Trash Compactor + Death Star Plans + A Droid\nFairly simple to pull off since you're playing all the Yavin 4 sites. Simple cards like Tunnel Vision or Hiding In The Garbage will help you get those Death Star sites.\n\nKessel System + Kessel Run + A Smuggler\nOK, I like to retrieve Force. A Force drain for three may be easier than usual because many Dark players are focused on capturing at sites with Bounty Hunters. Deploy another ship to the Alderaan system where Captain Han is hovering in the Falcon and send him to Kessel.\n\nEffective Repairs + Utinni Effects\nNot only does it cancel the annoying Limited Resources, but this card also allows you to retrieve any Utinni Effect into your hand, which is what all those precious Force retrieval cards just happen to be.\n\nTanus Spijek doesn't actually play much of a part in the Force retrieval, but after reading his card I came up with all of this. The few card which his game text makes essential for a deck around him is so nicely complimented by the Force retrieval opportunities. This deck has already won a couple times for me and is a lot of fun to play. Your opponent begins to become angry the third or fourth time you've successfully retrieved your entire Lost Pile! If you're still worried about Dark Side spies popping up or other ways for the Dark player to infiltrate Yavin 4, a card like Houjix is excellent in case you get totally taken by surprise and majorly overpowered in a battle, but the deck is character-heavy and those high destinies on the Force retrieval cards will serve you well in firing weapons and battle destinies.",

Each bluff card cumulatively adds 1 to your total Force drain at that site. During your deploy phase, your opponent can choose to flip over any of your bluff cards:\nIf it is a character or vehicle, you may attempt to deploy it (deploy cost = 0) to the Bluffs using normal rules of deployment (obeying uniqueness, deployment restrictions [including having presence or Force icons], etc.).\n\nIf it is not one of those cards, or you could not legally deploy it there, you lose 2 Force and the bluff card.",

    "Information": "Tatooine: Mos Eisley is the cornerstone for a Tatooine ground Force drain deck. The key to this strategy is to stay away from the Dark Side ground forces while continuing to force drain. Eventually, an opportunity usually presents itself to make a crippling counter-attack. This site, when combined with Tatooine: Cantina, form a strong site combination.\n\nOf primary importance is the ability to move Light Side characters for free during the control phase. This affords the Light Side player a number of large strategic advantages. First, this provides excellent force generation and Force drain opportunities. That the Dark Side gains some force generation is somewhat negated by the fact that they will have to play a sufficient Force at both sites to force a battle. With the Tatooine: Mos Eisley game text, avoiding the Dark Side task force is free, while the Dark Side player must pay to chase from site to site. The Light Side player can keep her entire force strong and protected at one location and still Force drain at both sites. If the Dark Side has no presence at either site, and the Light Side has at least two characters deployed at one of the sites, just move one character to the second site, execute both Force drains, and then move the rest of the characters over. Keep in mind that this counts as their movement for the turn.\nTo completely halt the force drains, the Dark Side will have to split her forces between the two sites. When it is advantageous, the Light Side player can use the free move in the control phase to move her whole Force over and attack immediately.\n\nTwo types of cards will augment this deck greatly. First, the Light Side player must keep the Dark Side from deploying and immediately initiating a battle. Narrow Escape and Rebel Barrier can both help with this, and the A NEw Hope cards I Have a Very Bad Feeling About This and R2-D2 with a Fire Extinguisher work as well. If the battle does start, Houjix can keep the results from being crippling by eliminating force loss. Lightsabers and Lightsaber Proficiency increase the Force drain at the sites, also a key. Quite a Mercenary will keep the Dark Side from launching a surprise attack via Elis Helrot. Include multiple Tatooine: Mos Eisley to keep them from being reversed.\n\nCards to watch out for: Dark Side Tatooine: Mos Eisley, Counter Assault.",

It will hack off half your opponent's Force, unless it takes you so long to pull it off that there's not much left. So speed it up. You'll find the cards you need to inflict massive damage in most Bounty or Carbon Freezing decks.\n\nFirst, get Docking Bay Control Room into play. It lets you spit out every Docking Bay in your deck, including those for Cloud City and the Death Star.\n\nStarting with the Detention Block Corridor or Carbonite Chamber is good too.\n\nSecond, weasel your opponent into playing Luke. Play Mii'yoom Onith and conveniently forget to use her for a couple of turns. See if your opponent puts Luke out. Or start early with a Scanning Crew philosophy, and see if that brings Luke out to play. When Luke is on the table, the number one rule is: don't kill him unless you have a We Have A Prisoner in your hand. You can afford to take some losses in this effort, you'll be doing a whole lot more later on.\n\nThird, get Luke frozen. Whether this means jacking up a Force drain at the Carbonite Chamber, and then pushing him in with All Too Easy, or going the long route and capturing him, and then Carbon Freezing him, Luke has to be frozen.\n\nFourth, and this is what you have to stock up for, put out the Prize, and make sure it and the frozen Luke are well protected. Make sure you have a steady stream of characters escorting Luke so that he's never alone. He'll be frozen for the rest of the game, but you don't want your opponent piling up with him. You'll also want to keep pesky rebels out of the Detention Block Corridor. This will make your life a whole lot easier.\n\nThis card's problem is actually getting Luke to the Detention Block Corridor after he's Frozen. There just isn't too much mobility in the game for interior sites, except for the card that could save your life. Lift Tube is a Premiere common that rarely sees use, but, if your plans are centered around the two systems with mobile sites, Lift Tubes can be invaluable. It can carry four passengers, more than enough for Luke and some protection, and, since both docking bays are Mobile sites, it can move through the Docking Bay, although you shouldn't need it on the Death Star.\n\nAfter that, you're set. Half of your opponent's Life Force is gone, and you'll have a nice little force with which to Force drain. It seems like a very hefty task, and it will probably take up most of your time simply trying to pull it off. Once you do, however, you notice quickly that is was all worthwile.",

Threepio shares Mirax Terrik's ability to circulate high destiny cards back into your deck and replace them with new cards from the Reserve Deck. What's even nicer about Threepio's ability is that, unlike Mirax, his ability can be used for free, and instead of placing the card on the bottom of the Used Pile, he places it on the top of the Used Pile for easier tracking when your Reserve Deck is larger.\n\nThe other nice thing about Threepio's ability to place a high destiny card on top of your Used Pile is that if he's in a battle with Shmi, he can then take that high destiny card and place it on top of your Reserve Deck, ensuring a nice pull for weapon or battle destiny. And since Shmi can download Threepio right out of the Reserve Deck, the odds of you having them in a battle together are pretty good.\n\nThe fact that this is a persona of C-3PO also has enormous benefits. Because most versions of C-3PO have only been strong in specialized decks, many of his support cards are quite powerful. For example, Were You Looking For Me? is a handy 5 Destiny Used Interrupt that allows you to pull Threepio and/or another protocol droid (like R-3PO) from your Reserve Deck. You can also use the same Interrupt as a Lost Interrupt to either retrieve Threepio from the Lost Pile or to add a battle destiny when Threepio is helping his friends out in battle (two battle destiny if he happens to have a few furry friends with him). Unlike most \"back\" cards, this card is very appealing because it's recyclable, free, high destiny, and has the battle destiny bonus.\n\nThere are tons of other C-3PO suppport cards, including the ever-popular How Did We Get Into This Mess?, but one of my favorites is Artoo, I Have A Bad Feeling About This, which has three different uses, the best of which allows you to squash your opponent's battle destiny completely if both Artoo and C-3PO are together in battle. Put Shmi, Artoo and Threepio together in a battle, and with the right support cards you can really put the hurt on the Dark Side.",

    "Information": "This card gives a shot in the arm to trooper decks. With this card and a couple of little tricks can allow troopers to be competitive in a number of different environments. Of course, the key to this deck is protecting the Trooper Assaults from Sense. Seven or eight Controls and a couple of Tentacles might be the advisable course of action for this mission.\n\nThis deck can revolve around the classic Force drain locations such as the Moisture Farm, Judland Wastes, Cantina and Defensive Perimeter. Control of the location can be established with about 4 Imperial Trooper Guards. With a Trooper Assault in hand, these guys are power 24 and immune to attrition. If more characters show up for the Light Side, a few more guards can be thrown into the mix and they all add six power each.\n\nThis is great for defending these locations, but of course doesn't do much for the attack. This is where another card can come in handy. Deploy Trooper Davin Felth or an Imperial Squad Leader and give them a Light Repeating Blaster Rifle and a power source. Blasted Droid will then allow the trooper to fire the LRBR with a destiny bonus pretty much until the Dark Side runs out of Reserve Deck. If the power source is a Portable Fusion Generator and the trooper is at the Moisture Farm or Defensive Perimeter, all of the shots will be at weapon destiny + three. Even Obi-Wan is fairly likely to run into a 4 destiny Trooper Assault from the Reserve Deck, wiping him out. And since the Imperial Trooper Guards are destiny 3, Son Of Skywalker can be hit when they are drawn using the LRBR add all of it's adders. Again, this combination needs protection from Sense.",

Much in the way that Death Star Gunners and Rebel Techs are necessary to make a Commence Primary Ignition or Attack Run deck go, these little guys are the key to making Rebels 'well preserved'. The Ugnaught advantage though, is that there are some other cards that allow them to play a more useful role.\n\nObviously, their prime purpose in the game is to pull off Carbon-Freezing. To do this, they each add one. Throw in Ugloste and this bonus just soars. What should not be overlooked is the ability to sacrifice a card to go and get a few things to facilitate the freezing process. This means that you can lose the key cards to the freezing process early, knowing that you can get them back later in the game. Get the Carbonite Chamber Console and not only do you get the bonus to freezing destiny, but suddenly more Ugnaughts, and even the Carbon-Freezing effect itself show up. Prepare The Chamber also helps both the destiny draw, and the Ugnaughts themselves.\n\nAnother advantage to these guys is that they can help outfit your bounty hunting crew. Who wouldn't lose two Force to give IG-88 a Light Repeating Blaster Rifle an a Portable Fusion Generator. Give him some Binders and he can do all the collection work for you. Also, with Ugloste, Ugnaughts provide a decent little fighting force on their own, especially with Prepare The Chamber. ",

Uncontrollable Fury could also be useful at systems, but the benefits of Vader (especially when combined with Tarkin) are not quite as powerful at systems and sectors due to the fact the Light Side cannot lose the forfeit value of cards due to Vader and his lightsaber while in space.\n\nSince the Premiere edition of the game, Light Side players have been searching for a way to counter the deadly combination of Grand Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader. Some solutions that have worked to one extent or another have been Demotion, Tarkin Seeker and playing space decks. An opinion that some top ranked players hold is that Vader is wasted in space when compared with his devastating effectiveness at sites. Uncontrollable Fury is another tool in this war. While there is a Dark Side card that can cancel it, the power of Uncontrollable Fury probably makes it more than worth the risk.\n\nThere are numerous avoidance strategies that can make use of the Force loss part of the card. The easiest of these is just to use Nabrun Leids to move away from Vader in each of the Dark Side's battle phases, and cause them to lose two Force per opponent's turn. Of course, that requires the Dark player to use Vader, but he is usually to good to pass up.\n-----\nDark side card against direct damage: Imperial Decree (V).",

    "Information": "When using this card as a Used Interrupt, you may search your Used Pile. Doesn't sound overly interesting. However, after deploying something like an Executor, or a normal star destroyer with pilots, you should have an interesting Used Pile. If you have plenty weapons in your deck, chances are good that you find a weapon there. This is also a very strong point, as you can take ONE weapon. It does not specify which weapon. Find a Superlaser there ? Take it. Vader needs his custom slice-toy and it's in the Used Pile ? Pick out Vader's Lightsaber and take it into your hand. Want to arm that star destroyer ? Weapon Levitate the Turbolaser Battery or Ion Cannon you see in your Used Pile. The possibilities are only limited by the weapons in your deck.\n\nThere is another use, the Lost Interrupt variant. For fun I'll give an example which actually happened. I had an unarmed Darth Vader at a site. Here comes Obi-Wan with a generic Jedi Lightsaber (his own toy was not deployed yet). Obi starts to battle and suddenly he feels the lightsaber wrenched from his grip, sees it flying through the room and into Darth Vaders hands. The last thing Obi-Wan ever saw, was Darth Vader slicing him with Obi's own surrogate toy.\n\nIn the game, Obi-Wan started the battle and I played Weapon Levitation as a Lost Interrupt. I snatched the Jedi Lightsaber and, as it can be used by any warrior, used it to slice Obi-Wan to ribbons. However, things get a little more interesting. The game text states, that you may 'steal' one character weapon present. OK, so you will not run off with a Planet Defender Ion Cannon. However, did you see Luke waving his Blaster Pistol (and you fear he will target you, to make Darth lose the immunity to attrition) ? 'Steal' the pistol. It is a character weapon. Do you see Djas Puhr against a Light Side character with a Blaster Rifle and your opponent starts the fight ? Use Weapon Levitation to 'steal' the rifle. You see, the great part is, that neither specific weapons, nor specific characters are mentioned. Any character of ability >3 can steal any character weapon (so you might even get a weapon back thet the Light Side once stole from you !).\n\nIn short, a good card to include in any deck, especially if you have a lot of weapons, a lot of ability 4+ characters, ... or both.\n\nStrong points:\n* Weapon Levitation = Destiny 4 - good to upgrade average destiny, good to draw destiny.\n* Weapon Levitation = Two cards for the price of one (Used and Lost variant).\n* Weapon Levitation = Uncommon, thus it should not be too hard to get.\n* Weapon Levitation = Surprise, as in, surprise your opponent by using his weapons against him, or at least get your weapons fast.\n\n\nWeak points:\n* Weapon Levitation = Not immune, so a Sense could ruin this little plan.\n* Weapon Levitation = Unique. You can't search a weapon, not find it and then use a second Weapon Levitation to 'steal' in one turn. ",

One of its Lost functions flat-out cancels the nasty interrupt You Are Beaten, a card that should be canceled when at all possible. Apart from Sense, this is the best way to cancel that Dark interrupt. The final Lost use of Weapon Levitation plays if a battle was just initiated, allowing one of your characters present with ability greater than three to steal one character weapon present. Stealing a troublesome weapon may come in handy from time to time, but all three functions and its attractive destiny number make it a good utility card to include in certain decks.\n\nThe Dark Side has enjoyed this fantastic interrupt since Cloud City, and, finally, the Light Side gets its turn. Weapon Levitation can be a great way to swipe an important weapon such as Vader's Lightsaber, without putting yourself in too much of a random situation (like Sabacc.)

First, the Used function plays when a lightsaber was just used to enhance a Force drain, and puts that lightsaber into the owner's Used Pile. This is very obnoxious to do after Mara or Son Of Skywalker has used their \"once per game\" ability. Putting an opponent's lightsaber into the Used Pile is beneficial since it takes away the Force drain bonus for the following turn, and it removes the battle / duel advantage that a saber provides. Also, late in the game, you can put one of your lightsabers into your Used Pile to help boost your differential. As a Lost Interrupt, this works even better for this purpose, as you may place any or all of your devices and character weapons on table into your Used Pile. These counterparts are a must in any deck utilizing a quantity of devices and character weapons, and allows them to be used without the disadvantage of being too card-intensive. For a funny Light Side combo, put a bunch on high destiny devices into the Used Pile while Descent Into The Dark is out, then battle or Surprise Assault.",

From Gift of the Mentor to Skywalkers, the Light Side has plenty of interrupts to throw at you. There are times when you just plain don't have enough Senses and Alters to take care of the job. So, what do you do?\n\nThere are a number of what we like to call \"tension\" cards that the Dark Side may use to its advantage. These cards show relationships between Light Side characters at vulnerable moments. Scruffy Looking Nerf Herder is the first and best-known of these tension cards. In Scruffy Looking Nerf Herder, Leia and Han's usual strong bond hits a weak spot and allows the Dark Side to draw two destiny and to subtract that amount from the Light Side opponent's attrition and total power.\n\nSince every Light Side deck uses Luke in one form or another, including a card to counter an opponent using one of the personas of Luke is a good idea. Why Didn't You Tell Me? cancels Gift Of The Mentor and the popular Force regeneration card, Noble Sacrifice. It's a rare game when Yoda doesn't bite the big one because of Noble Sacrifice (gaining the Light Side 9 Force!), so canceling it is good idea.\n\nIn a battle against Luke, Why Didn't You Tell Me can hamper your opponent significantly. Some of the Light Side strategies deal with simply deploying a main character, and trying to chip away at the an opposing vehicle, character, or starship, and hope that the other cards' Forfeit guides them through the Force loss. With a good destiny draw, this hope can be at least stemmed, as those cards battle destiny dwindles from a five or six to a mere one or two. Not a problem, simply add another counter to your Septoid Droid.",

Oh wait...what are those other Force there for? YOU ARE BEATEN!!!!! Target OBI, oh, my dear, what's that? Obi CAN'T PARTICIPATE IN THE BATTLE OR MOVE until the end of your NEXT turn. It helps a little, don't ya see?

    "Information": "Startable with Prepared Defenses.\n-----\nThis card heralds the return of the almighty Walker Garrison deck. Being able to start this effect with Prepared Defenses is a great boost to this classic deck type. On your first turn, you can immediately go and grab the 3rd Marker, which combined with the 5th Marker gives you 4 red icons and a +1 Force Drain location, while the Light Side only gets one blue icon from you in the bargain. Plus, you are guaranteed to have a Walker Garrison in hand right from the get-go, so you are all set to drain like mad once you've got all your Walkers in position.\n\nThe best part of this card, however, is its ability to deal direct damage just by occupying Hoth marker sites with AT-ATs, which any self-respecting Walker Garrison deck has in abundance. If you choose No Escape as one of your starting effects, this direct damage will not be cancelled by Honor of the Jedi, which is a good thing since your force drains at non-battlegrounds will be negated by that powerful Light Side card. Be sure to pack a couple Presence of the Force to help turn those Marker Sites into battlegrounds and add to your drains in the bargain.\n\nFor a third starting effect for this deck type, you probably want to start with Imperial Arrest Order. This will give a big boost to all your Walker pilots, and allow you to deploy the Hoth: Echo Docking Bay right away, a great place to plop a Walker to help drain with Walker Garrison. Unfortunately, the Docking Bay isn't a Marker Site, but it's still a great battleground to drain at with your Walkers. An alternative starting effect is Imperial Decree, which is pretty easy to keep active with this deck and which can really hurt those cowardly Rebels.",

    "Information": "At first glance, you might say, \"Hey, why would I play this card?\" After all, although it gives the Light Side a chance to duel, it automatically starts you at a disadvantage, giving the Dark Side two destiny to your one. And although having Luke placed out of play might seem appealing versus a Bring Him Before Me deck, you can't play this card when that Objective is out (due to the Objective's card text).\n\nSo what's the point? Well, if you're willing to devote a few extra cards to your Mains deck, this card can certainly be an unwelcome surprise for the Dark Side. Most decks carry a Vader or three, so devoting a bit of your strategy to this card can usually be effective. And it is a 6 Destiny card, so it will always have that bit of usefulness. Now, play two or three of these cards in your deck, and you've got some of the high destiny you need to succeed with this card.\n\nAlso, pack Courage of Skywalker to give you another destiny to even things out a bit with the old Dark Lord. And let's not forget Glancing Blow, which allows you to cancel one of the Dark Side's duelling destiny draws or, if you play You'll Find I'm Full of Surprises during the weapons segment of a battle, you can use Glancing Blow to nail Vader's power, knocking it to an unmodifiable zero, which means he won't even get the +2 power from holding his lightsaber granted by the Interrupt. Suddenly, Vader's chances of winning have become quite slim, and it looks like he's going away for a very long time.\n\nHaving this sort of a side strategy not only lets you beat up Luke's favorite sparring partner, but also gives you a plethora of cards to defend yourself during duels initiated by the Dark Side with such cards as Epic Duel or new cards like Darth Maul.\n\nSome new Tatooine cards that can help you win the day versus Vader include A Jedi's Focus: which lets you add the destiny of the top card of the Lost Pile to your total, A Jedi's Patience: which lets you redraw one of your bad duelling destiny draws, and most importantly, A Jedi's Resilience, which allows you to cancel a duel AFTER you've lost it AND take the duelling card back into your hand!\n\nBut watch out for the new Dark Side card, Lightsaber Parry, or your duel might suddenly become very expensive!",

    "Rules": "Draw X Choose Y\nWhen a card instructs you to draw x destiny and choose y, perform the following steps:\nStep 1) Draw a destiny. This draw can be modified, canceled, reset, or otherwise responded to normally just after it is drawn; however, after being drawn, unless canceled, it remains an Unresolved Destiny Draw and is not yet placed in Used Pile. The draw is considered a weapon destiny, battle destiny, etc. where appropriate, and counts against any applicable limits. If a limit prevents a player from drawing more than x destinies, they instead draw a number of destinies equal to the limit. Repeat this step until x destinies have been drawn.\nStep 2) Once x destines have been drawn, choose a destiny from among the Unresolved Destiny Draws and resolve it normally. Repeat this step until an appropriate number of destinies have been chosen as specified by y.\nStep 3) Place any remaining unresolved draws in used pile (unless otherwise instructed) in the order they were drawn (if possible).\n\n\nNote that this means any just action responding to a just drawn destiny in a Draw X Choose Y situation must do so when it is DRAWN (in step 1) and not when it is CHOSEN (in step 2). Once the process has moved on to Step 2, with the player who drew choosing which destinies to use, the draws can no longer be responded to as just drawn.\n\nAlso worth noting is that all destinies drawn with a Draw X Choose Y card count against applicable limits or other cards that count the number of destinies, even if they are not chosen. That is to say, limits count the number of destinies drawn, not the number of destinies chosen. To illustrate, here are a few examples:\n\nExample 1: Dash in Rogue 10 (applicable text: During battle, if with another T-47 and about to draw a battle destiny, may draw two and choose one.) is in a battle with another T-47, and the Light Side player is limited to ONE battle destiny. In this situation Dash in Rogue 10's 'draw 2 and choose 1' text cannot be used because both destinies drawn with Dash count as battle destiny draws.\n\nExample 2: If a similar situation played out, but the Light Side player was limited 2 battle destinies instead of 1, the Light Side player using Dash in Rogue 10's text on 1 destiny would reach the limit of two battle destinies on its own, because even though only one such destiny would be chosen, two destinies were still drawn. If the light side player had a way to add a battle destiny in this example, they would be better off NOT using Dash in Rogue 10's text and simply drawing 2 normal destinies, because using Dash in Rogue 10's text on the first destiny would cause them to reach the limit of 2, preventing them from drawing the added battle destiny after.\n\nExample 3: Dash in Rogue 10 is in a battle with Commander Luke Skywalker v piloting Rogue 1 (so that Luke draws 2 battle destiny if unable to otherwise). Luke's text will be usable because when it checks how many destinies Light Side is scheduled to draw at the beginning of the power segment, it will only see 1. (Luke's text only counts one destiny able to be drawn because Dash in Rogue 10's text has not triggered yet - it is only usable when the Light Side is about to draw a battle destiny) While the Light Side may theoretically use Dash in Rogue 10's text to draw 2 and choose 1 on the first destiny drawn, they would no longer be able to draw the 2nd destiny with Luke's text, because players may never combine multiple destiny drawing to draw more than the 'if unable to otherwise' text allows (see \"Battle Destiny - Draws X Battle Destiny If Unable To Otherwise\" on AR page 6-6). In this case, drawing 2 and choosing 1 on the first destiny and attempting to draw the second would mean the Light Side would be drawing 3 battle destinies, which would be prevented by 'if unable to otherwise' rules. If the first destiny with Luke's text is drawn normally, the Light Side player may not use Dash in Rogue 10's text on the second destiny from Luke's text, because again, that would result in the Light Side player drawing 3 destinies and would be prevented. In short, like example 2, the Light Side player would be better off simply drawing 2 normal battle destinies rather than using Dash in Rogue 10's text in this situation.",
